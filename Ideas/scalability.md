	## SCALABILITY
   ### Adding **independent** modules

The things that make this program efficient can be the next ones:
	1. Containers used in
	2. Types of acces to the containers
	3. Operations with containers
	4. Good modular design
Assuming that the database for this program would be in a correct format 
and of a big size, these 3 aspects are very important to guarantee a 
good execution of the program and not to crash.
