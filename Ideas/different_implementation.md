	## A DIFERENT IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM
   ### Using **machine learning** for it

If we want to make the program's outputs more accurate a good option 
for that would be using machine learning. 

The original program uses a fictional database created by the 
developers with the next attributes:
	1. The real task that the user wants to check
	2. The theoric task that the program uses
	3. Some factors that influence the time that you spend doing the
	task
	4. The theoric time printed by the program
	5. The real time that you spend on this task
With this we can conclude that the similar are the theoric and real
times between them, the more accuracy gives the program. For doing that,
it is important to have a good control of the error that we 
have in each execution.

A solution that can be done using machine learning is to have a 
register of which is the error in that execution. Then with machine 
learning one of the 5 attributes of before would be the one that 
causes the most error, and when it is identifyed, change it and repeat 
the execution until the error is minimal
